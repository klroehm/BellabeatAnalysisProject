Bellabeat Analysis Project using SQL
The first step is counting the number of unique Ids in the dataset.
  SELECT COUNT(Distinct Id) as Unique_Ids
  FROM `Fitness.Activity`
  --This returned a result of 33 unique entrants.
I wanted to get an idea of what percentage of the time users were very active vs fairly active vs lightly active
  SELECT (VeryActiveMinutes/TotalActiveMinutes)*100  as Very_Active_Percentage, 
  (FairlyActiveMinutes/TotalActiveMinutes)*100 as Fairly_Active_Percentage, 
  (LightlyActiveMinutes/TotalActiveMinutes)*100 as Lightly_Active_Percentage
  FROM Fitness.Activity
  WHERE TotalActiveMinutes <> 0
Then, I wanted to find the average total steps taken per day

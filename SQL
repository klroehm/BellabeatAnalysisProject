Bellabeat Analysis Project using SQL

The first step is counting the number of unique Ids in the dataset.
  SELECT COUNT(Distinct Id) as Unique_Ids
  FROM `Fitness.Activity`
  --This returned a result of 33 unique entrants.
  
I wanted to get an idea of what percentage of the time users were very active vs fairly active vs lightly active
  SELECT (VeryActiveMinutes/TotalActiveMinutes)*100  as Very_Active_Percentage, 
  (FairlyActiveMinutes/TotalActiveMinutes)*100 as Fairly_Active_Percentage, 
  (LightlyActiveMinutes/TotalActiveMinutes)*100 as Lightly_Active_Percentage
  FROM Fitness.Activity
  WHERE TotalActiveMinutes <> 0
  
Then, I wanted to find the average total steps taken per day
   SELECT AVG(TotalSteps)
   FROM Fitness.Activity
  
Average Distance per day
    SELECT AVG(Distance)
    FROM Fitness.Activity
    
Total Monthly number of steps by each unique ID number
  SELECT Id, SUM(TotalSteps) as Total_Monthly_Steps
  FROM Fitness.Activity
  GROUP BY Id
  
Average Total Hours of Sleep per day
  SELECT AVG(TotalMinutesAsleep)/60 as AverageHoursAsleep
  FROM Fitness.Sleep
  
Average Calories burned per day
  SELECT AVG(Calories)
  FROM Fitness.Activity
  
Calories burned per minute active
  SELECT Id, ActivityDate, Calories/(LightlyActiveMinutes+FairlyActiveMinutes+VeryActiveMinutes) as Calorie_per_active_minute
  FROM Fitness.Activity
  WHERE (FairlyActiveMinutes <> 0 and VeryActiveMinutes <>0 and LightlyActiveMinutes <>0)
  
Percent of days that users got over 10,000 steps 
  SELECT COUNT(*)/940*100
  FROM Fitness.Activity
  WHERE TotalSteps >10000
  
Percent of day spent sedentary
  SELECT Id, ActivityDate, (SedentaryMinutes/1440)*100 as percentage_sedentary
  FROM Fitness.Activity

I want to merge the Sleep dataset with the Activity dataset, joined by common ID numbers 
SELECT f.ActivityDate,f.ID, s.Id, s.TotalMinutesAsleep, f.TotalSteps
FROM Fitness.Activity as f
LEFT JOIN Fitness.Sleep as s on f.Id = s.Id
ORDER BY ActivityDate
